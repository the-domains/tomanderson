Most coffee shops close at 6 or 9 pm, but I have found an exception. OTR convenient stores are 24 hours, and although some locations are drive-through, others have seating areas and restaurants like Subway. And the best part is that they are open 24 hours a day. There's no power points available, but as long as my laptop is charged up, I can pull late hour writing sessions with free soda refills!</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Did you notice that NBNCo has it's own definition of "non-metropolitan" that does not comply with the legal definitions for planning? </p>,<p>"'Metropolitan Adelaide' is a geographic area legally defined by a declaration by the Minister responsible for planning and development matters (under section 4 of the Development Act 1993). The most recent declaration was made on 11 November 1993... East: through the Adelaide Hills, east of the towns of Bridgewater and One Tree Hill." Adelaide metropolitan area extends through the hills to (but not including) Mount Barker. http://www.atlas.sa.gov.au/resources/metropolitan-adelaide-boundary pursuant to Development Act 1993 http://www.atlas.sa.gov.au/files/metro_Adelaide_bnd.pdf  </p>]]></description>
