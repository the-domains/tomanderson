Did you notice that NBNCo has it's own definition of "non-metropolitan" that does not comply with the legal definitions for planning? 

"'Metropolitan Adelaide' is a geographic area legally defined by a declaration by the Minister responsible for planning and development matters (under section 4 of the Development Act 1993). The most recent declaration was made on 11 November 1993... East: through the Adelaide Hills, east of the towns of Bridgewater and One Tree Hill." Adelaide metropolitan area extends through the hills to (but not including) Mount Barker. http://www.atlas.sa.gov.au/resources/metropolitan-adelaide-boundary pursuant to Development Act 1993 http://www.atlas.sa.gov.au/files/metro\_Adelaide\_bnd.pdf  

Looking at Stirling and doubtless other "metropolitan" areas, NBNCo designates these areas as "non-metropolitan". Seems like they can override legal definitions now. Sure makes for fancy accounting tricks though! Throwing the harder to deal with into the rural basket will hide the cost overruns. They might as well. Is there no external accounting? 

I should note that "Adelaide Hills" is considered outside Adelaide Metropolitan region according to some sa.gov.au websites, for whatever reason. But I could not find any legal designations, only informal ones. On the other hand, abs.gov.au explicitly states "The ABS does not define Metropolitan and non-Metropolitan areas." http://www.abs.gov.au/websitedbs/D3310114.nsf/home/Frequently+Asked+Questions\#Anchor8 But the Capital City Statistical Division for Adelaide includes all of the legal definition with the addition of Mount Barker. Here's the map: http://betaworks.abs.gov.au/betaworks/betaworks.nsf/projects/ASGSBoundariesOnline/ASGSBoundariesOnline/index.html?xmin=15340065.250162382&ymin=-4215028.066628151&xmax=15596435.043030962&ymax=-4103888.6275014617&toplayer=GCCSA

Gawler is "non-metropolitan" but within the "metropolitan" legally defined area. http://www.mynbn.info/sa/5GNG
  
Lenswood is in Metropolitan area I noted above, but "non-metropolitan" http://www.mynbn.info/sa/5LEN
  
Onkaparingam 2184 premises, designated "Non-Metro" by NBN but within "metropolitan" as above. http://www.mynbn.info/sa/5ONK
  
Stirling has 9390 premises, but is also considered "non-metropolitan". http://www.mynbn.info/sa/5STI

Mount Barker has 12,047 premises. It's barely outside the Adelaide metropolitan area as defined above, but large towns are apparently "non-metropolitan". http://www.mynbn.info/sa/5MTB
  
Mount Gambier is also a considered a major town in South Australia. It's well away from the Adelaide metropolitan area by whatever definition, and projected over 16000 premises. http://www.mynbn.info/sa/5MTG 

On another note, most metropolitan areas are designated "metropolitan", but I see at least three areas, Henley Beach, Gepps Cross and Golden Grove, show up as neither "metropolitan" nor "non-metropolitan". In the database they are "Metro". Is someone typing these in manually? (NBN database skills are wretched. This is not the first big error I've seen. They changed their database after Libs took it over, and lost data along the way, my address no longer existing!) Sure hope nobody is generating reports using a search like "SELECT area FROM nbncrapdb WHERE designation = 'metropolitan'" -- that's going to miss and undercount those designated 'Metro'. If you know anything about computers, when you notice several problems in a given system, there are invariably many more. http://www.mynbn.info/sa/5HNL http://www.mynbn.info/sa/5GPC http://www.mynbn.info/sa/5GNG
